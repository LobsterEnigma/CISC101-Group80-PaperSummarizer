# Module 1: Intake & Setup

## Purpose
Normalize the paper’s structure and prepare for summarization.

## Instructions
- Detect and list all sections (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion).
- Normalize section names (e.g., "Intro" → "Introduction").
- Identify missing sections and mark them as "Missing".
- Detect very short sections (<50 words) and flag them for guardrail handling.
- Prepare text chunks if any section exceeds the context window (chunk by paragraphs or subsections).
